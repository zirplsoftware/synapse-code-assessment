# Synapse Code Assessment

## Overview

This solution is divided logically by numbered folders (for automatic sorting in Visual Studio) based
on most general code to most specific code. Generally, projects in higher numbered folders
depend on projects in lower numbered folders. 

Please review README files in each project for reasoning behind
architural decisions.

I recognize that this solution could be considered vastly over-engineered for the assignment, but I treated it 
as if I was starting this is as a new long-term project that will grow and be maintained by multiple developers. I
also wrote it to support both .Net Framework and .Net, simply because it made my life easier with my previous client
to have a single codebase that could be used in both environments.
