# Synapse Code Assessment

Thank you for this opportunity. This is a unique assignment for assessing a candidate's skills,
and I very much enjoyed it. I feel that the result accurately reflects my approach not 
just to refactoring code, finding bugs, and writing new code, but to improving
the software development process, and resulting products, in general. 
I recognize that this solution could be considered 
vastly over-engineered for the assignment. But I treated it 
as if I was the architect and coder on a new long-term enterprise suite of applications, 
maintained by multiple developers. I also designed it (primarily by project type choice)
to support both .Net Framework and .Net, to underscore my consideration of future needs 
when making architectural decisions. I will certainly have this candidate assessment approach in mind if
I ever need to interview candidates again in the future. I hope to meet you in an interview soon!

## Overview

This solution is divided logically by numbered folders (for automatic sorting in Visual Studio) based
on most general code to most specific code. Projects in lower numbered folders 
are dependencies for projects in higher numbered folders. 

Please review README files in each project for reasoning behind
architural decisions.
