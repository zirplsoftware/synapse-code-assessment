// NOTE: I personally prefer logging of exceptions to occur
// at the highest level possible, which is usually before
// they are eaten. Often but not always the entry point.
// In this case, logging is appearing throughout the code
// since that approach requires more thoughtful design and more time
// than an evaluation allows.
